# 1. Write a program to swap two numbers.
# a = 10
# b = 20
# a, b = b, a      # this way only allow in python.
# print (f"Before swaping a=10 & b=20 \nAfter swapping :\n a= {a} & b= {b}")

# By using 3rd variable to swap no.
# a = 10
# b = 20
# temp = b
# b = a 
# print(f"Before swpping a=10 & b=20 \n After swapping a= {temp} & b= {a}")

# 2. How to check number is prime or not.
#prime no. are those who divisible by one and itself only

# a = int(input("Enter no."))
# temp = a % 2
# if temp != 0:
#     print(f"Enter {a} number is prime number" )
# else:
#     print(f"Enter {a} is not prime number")
    
# for i in range (0,100):
#     print(i)
# i=0
# while(i<100):
#     print(i)
#     i += 1
